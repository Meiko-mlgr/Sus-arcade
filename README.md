# Sus Arcade 
A mini-game arcade inspired by Indie game "Among Us," built with a modern React frontend. This project is a portfolio piece showcasing component-based architecture and clean, scalable code.


## About The Project
"Sus Arcade" is a web application that will host a collection of simple, fun mini-games with an "Among Us" theme. The project was inspired by the clean UI of modern betting sites but reimagined as a friendly, task-based arcade.

The primary goal is to build a scalable frontend that can easily accommodate new games in the future, while demonstrating best practices in React development.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) (via [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/))
- **Styling:** [Vanilla CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) with [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- **Version Control:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Current Features
As of the latest commit, the following features are implemented:

**Responsive App Layout:** A clean, dark-themed layout that works on desktop and mobile.

**Game Lobby:** A functional main menu where users can see and select from the available games.

**Component-Based Structure:** The application is broken down into reusable components (App, GameLobby, MineGames).

**Mines Game ("Clear Asteroids"):** 
- A fully playable client-side Minesweeper game with win/loss conditions and a restart feature.
    - A polished settings screen with custom UI controls.
    - Adjustable grid size and mine count.

# Future Features (Roadmap)
The following features are planned for development:

**Plinko Game:** Implement the logic and UI for the "Calibrate Fuel Injector" plinko game.

**User Authentication:** Allow users to create accounts and log in.

**Backend Integration:** Connect the frontend to a Node.js backend to manage game state and leaderboards.
